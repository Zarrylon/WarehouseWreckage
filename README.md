# Warehouse Wreckage
## Description
Section 2 project from "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Code Your Own Unreal Games" course by GameDev.tv.

Also added my own modifications based on what I've learned in the course.

## Gameplay
Wreak chaos in the warehouse! Players need to shoot props to push them out of the map.

Game logic was created by using blueprints and physics.

## New (compared to course)
* Win condition : get rid of props in the warehouse.
